    <h1>The Cascade Algorithm</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules
        apply to an HTML element. It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be purple.

        Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this. The
        cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.</p>
    <p><b>1. Position and order of appearance:</b> the order in which your CSS rules appear</p>

    <h1>Effect of Position</h1>
    <p>If there are two rules that have selectors of identical specificity, the last one to be declared won. In an HTML page, you can add styles in different ways: through a  &lt;link&gt; tag, a &lt;style&gt; tag, or directly in the element's &lt;style&gt; attribute. If you have one &lt;link&gt; tag at the top of your page and another at the bottom, the styles from the bottom one will be used. The same goes for style tags; the ones lower down on the page take priority.

        An inline style attribute with CSS declared in it will override all other CSS, regardless of its position, unless a declaration has !important defined.
        
        If the browser doesn't support a property, it is ignored!</p>

    <p><b>Specificity:</b> an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match</p>
    <p><b>Origin:</b> the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from
        a browser extension, or your authored CSS</p>
    <p><b>Importance:</b> some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
        Lets look into all these one by one</p>
    <h1>Specificity</h1>
    <p>important > inline style > id Selector > class Selector > element Selector > universal Selector</p>
    <h1>Specificity calculation</h1>
    <p>To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Universal Selector: 0</li>
        <li>Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1</li>
        <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10</li>
        <li>ID selectors: 100</li>
        <li>Inline styles: 1000</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Importance</h1>
    <p>The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance, overriding
        any other competing styles. When you add !important to a CSS rule, it will take precedence over other rules
        affecting the same element, regardless of their specificity. For example, if you have:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            p {
                color: red !important;
              }
              
            p {
                color: blue;
              }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>The text in the &lt;p&gt; element will be red, not blue, because the !important flag makes that rule more
        important.

        an !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. This is the highest
        specificity that one individual item can get.

        However, it's generally best to use !important sparingly, as it can make debugging and maintaining your
        stylesheets more complicated. It can override styles in ways that are hard to trace, leading to unexpected
        results.</p>
